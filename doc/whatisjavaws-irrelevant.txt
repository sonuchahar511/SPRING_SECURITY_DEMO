The Java Web Start software allows you to download and run Java applications from the web

The Java Web Start software is launched automatically, when a Java application using Java Web Start
technology is downloaded for the first time. The Java Web Start software caches the entire
application locally on your computer.

Java Web Start is an implementation of the Java Network Launching Protocol (JNLP) specification.
Java Web Start works by using a special file called the JNLP descriptor, which is a small XML
document that contains elements and attributes that tell Java Web Start how to run the application.
That JNLP file instructs Java Web Start software to download, cache, and run the application.

In order to create and deploy an application, we must undergo the following steps:

Create a simple application and package it into a .jar file.
Sign the newly created .jar file.
Create the .jnlp file of our application.
Place all files inside a Web Server, such as Apache Tomcat 7.
Access, download and execute our created .jar file from the web.

    create jar
        jar -cf JNLPExample.jar *.*

    create a keystore and sign our executable .jar file with it
        keytool -genkey -keystore testkeys -alias stathis
        jarsigner -keystore testkeys JNLPExample.jar stathis
